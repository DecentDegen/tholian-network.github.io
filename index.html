					<h1>Tholian Network</h1>
					<h2>The Web of Knowledge</h2>
					<p>
						We build an accessible and automateable <q>Web of Knowledge</q>
						that will help its users to extract, learn and understand
						the semantic knowledge our Web already contains.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's improve access to Knowledge for generations to come.
						Together, in a decentralized, peer-to-peer and uncensorable manner.
					</p>

					<h3>We uncover the Web</h3>
					<p>
						Stealth, our Open Source Web Browser/Scraper/Proxy, is built from scratch and
						allows to browse the Semantic Web and to optimize Sites for the extraction of
						Knowledge while ensuring a maximum amount of Privacy and Security.
					</p>
					<p>
						Its unique concept allows it to run in a headless manner on Servers, Desktop Computers,
						Mobile Devices and on Embedded Computers - while allowing to share its Internet
						Connection and Cache efficiently among all trusted Peers in the local (or global)
						Network.
					</p>
					<p>
						The User Interface is built with Automation in mind, therefore focussing on
						the creation and integration of Beacons and Echoes.
					</p>

					<h3>We extract the Web</h3>
					<p>
						Stealth's and Radar's Beacons allow to transform Sites into readable and
						consumable content.
					</p>
					<p>
						The idea behind Beacons is that they allow to automate the process of creating
						Adapters in a manner that the statistical model behind a Site can be used as
						training data for neural networks, allowing to auto-label similar Sites in an
						automated manner.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the necessary threshold for peer-to-peer training data is reached, most
						Sites with similar designs and layouts can be processed in a fully automated
						manner without human supervision.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>We automate the Web</h3>
					<p>
						Stealth's and Radar's Echoes allow to record user interactions with the Web
						and to replay them based on conditions, variables, and in a repeatable manner.
					</p>
					<p>
						The idea behind Echoes is that they allow to automate every human interaction
						with Sites, such as filling out Web Forms, entering specific search terms,
						clicking Buttons or following linked Sites.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the necessary threshold for peer-to-peer training data is reached, all
						Stealth instances can benefit from previously shared Echoes, allowing all
						its users to automate their own interactions with Sites on the Web.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>We understand the Web</h3>
					<p>
						Radar, our Knowledge Tracker, is built from scratch and allows to track
						and persist shared Beacons and Echoes in the peer-to-peer Tholian Network.
					</p>
					<p>
						Its unique concept allows Human Users to share their Beacons and Echoes
						with their trusted Peers in a local or global manner with other Stealth
						instances.
					</p>
					<p>
						The User Interface and Services allow our registered Users to benefit
						from existing Adapters for Sites that they want to automate. If a Site
						was automated already, its Beacons and Echoes are immediately available
						and synchronized automatically among the Tholian Network.
